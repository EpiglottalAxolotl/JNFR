everyone
knows
mario
is
cool
as
fuck
but
who
knows
what
hes
thinking
who
knows
why
he
crushes
turtles
and
why
do
we
think
about
him
as
fondly
as
we
think
of
the
mythical
nonexistent
dr
pepper
perchance
i
believe
it
was
kant
who
said
experience
without
theory
is
blind
but
theory
without
experience
is
mere
intellectual
play
mario
exhibits
experience
by
crushing
turts
all
day
but
he
exhibits
theory
by
stating
lets
a
go
keep
it
up
baby
when
mario
leaves
his
place
of
safety
to
stomp
a
turty
he
knows
that
he
may
die
and
yet
for
a
man
who
can
purchase
lives
with
money
a
life
becomes
a
mere
store
of
value
a
tax
that
can
be
paid
for
much
as
a
rich
man
feels
any
law
with
a
fine
is
a
price
we
think
of
mario
as
a
hero
but
he
is
simply
a
one
percenter
of
a
more
privileged
variety
the
lifekind
perchance
pretty
sure
that
all
that
exists
of
it
